# DustDuinoWiFly
DustDuino that sends readings over WiFi network to Xively feed.

The preferred choice for those who want to watch their DustDuino readings from anywhere. The DustDuinoWiFly sketch was developed so that users could set up a DustDuino indoors that connects to the home's WiFi network, and sends readings to an Open Dust Map server, or the Xively internet of things service. Compatible with most WiFi modules that use the Xbee form factor and the Roving Networks RN-171 module, such as the Sparkfun RN-XV. Repository includes the required WiFly library.

# OpenDustMap DustDuino server

The included DustDuinoWiFly sketch is compatible with the Open Dust Map dustduino-server, which is a REST API that collects data from DustDuino air sensors. Additional information, along with code, is at https://github.com/OpenDustMap/.
